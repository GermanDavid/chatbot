## Configuration

When deploying the application, the following environment variables can be set:

| Environment Variable  | Default value                  | Description                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| OPENAI_API_KEY        |                                | The default API key used for authentication with OpenAI |
| DEFAULT_MODEL         | `gpt-3.5-turbo`                | The default model to use on new conversations           |
| DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT | [see here](utils/app/const.ts) | The defaut system prompt to use on new conversations    |

If you do not provide an OpenAI API key with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, users will have to provide their own key.
If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
